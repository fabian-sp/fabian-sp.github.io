About me
-------------
I am a researcher working on Optimization for Machine Learning. Since September 2024, I am a postdoc at Inria Paris, advised by Francis Bach, Umut Simsekli, and Adrien Taylor. Previously, I obtained my PhD at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), supervised by Professor Michael Ulbrich. [[Thesis]](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1734714/1734714.pdf)


**Research Overview.** I am interested in stochastic optimization algorithms for machine learning, and related topics in computation and statistics. One common theme of my past work is trying to understand and simplify training recipes for ML models. For example:

* Understanding the behaviour of learning-rate schedules for LLM training ([link to paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18965))
* Developing adaptive learning-rate methods based on the Polyak step size ([**MoMo**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07583), [**ProxSPS**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jWr41htaB3))
* Bridging optimization theory and practice of LLM training (for example through scaling laws)
