About me
-------------
I am a PhD student in mathematical optimization at TUM (Technical University of Munich), supervised by Professor Michael Ulbrich. My interests surround optimization in general, and more specifically stochastic optimization algorithms, machine learning and related topics in computation and statistics. Feel free to approach me in case you like any of these topics (*email* firsstname.lastname@tum.de).
