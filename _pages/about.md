About me
-------------
I am a researcher working on Optimization for Machine Learning. Since September 2024, I am a postdoc at Inria Paris, advised by Francis Bach, Umut Simsekli, and Adrien Taylor. Previously, I obtained my PhD at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), supervised by Professor Michael Ulbrich.


**Research Overview.** A common theme of my past work is to understand, simplify, and ultimately improve training recipes for ML models. As a result, my research is often trying to bridge optimization theory and machine learning practice.

Selection of recent works:

*  Understanding the behaviour of learning-rate schedules for LLM training [[ICML 2025]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18965)
* What are good optimizers for training diffusion models? [[EurIPS 2025]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19376) 
* Developing training algorithms that need less tuning ([**MoMo** [ICML 2024]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07583) and a proximal Polyak step size [[TMLR 2023]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jWr41htaB3))
