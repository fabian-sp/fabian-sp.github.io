About me
-------------
I am a PhD student in optimization at TU Munich. My interests surround optimization in general, and more specifically stochastic optimization algorithms, machine learning and related topics in computation and statistics. Feel free to approach me in case you like any of these topics.

News
----------
* My Python package `GGLasso` contains implementations for solving several forms of Graphical Lasso problems. Have a look at the package on [Github](https://github.com/fabian-sp/GGLasso) or see the [documentation](https://gglasso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
